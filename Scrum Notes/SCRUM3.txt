Meeting time: 3/31/2025 During morning lecture-time (9:10)

1) Final tasks left to do:
    -Category item counts
    -'transaction complete' popup needs total cost from localstorage
    -Include order IDs in drink cards so it's easier to send requests to backend
    -Order submission needs to save to database

2) Self-review:
    -Test placing an order and see what we think:
        -Standardize the length of item cards (they stretch based on what toppings were selected)
        -Doesn't go back to landing page after submitting an order

3) Next steps:
    -Edit & duplicate order buttons in view-order page

4) Discuss how to solve future issues:
    -How to do cashier page (vs customer self-service): copy self-service screen but get employee_id from their account
    -Order editing & duplication: Re-use order creation dialogue, for duplication we can copy from duplicate 
    -AI generating image thumbnails for drinks
